## 📘 Key Points

### Purpose
Defines **detailed functional and non-functional requirements** of the software system. Describes **what the system should do** to meet business needs.

### Focus
Translates the **business requirements (from BRD)** into **technical specifications** for developers and testers.

### Audience
Primarily for **developers, QA engineers, system analysts, and project managers**.

### Content Includes
- Functional requirements for all modules  
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability, scalability)  
- System interfaces and dependencies  
- Data models and input/output specifications  
- Assumptions and constraints

### Scope
Defines **system boundaries**, features, and **what will be implemented**. Clarifies **in-scope and out-of-scope items**.

### Benefits
- Provides a **clear blueprint** for development and testing  
- Ensures **developers and testers understand expected behavior**  
- Reduces **ambiguity and errors** in implementation  
- Serves as a **reference for future maintenance or enhancements**

### Format
Usually a **formal document** with structured sections, tables, and diagrams to clearly communicate requirements.

### Versioning
Track changes with **version numbers, dates, and author names** to maintain document integrity.

### Review Process
Must be **reviewed and approved by developers, testers, and stakeholders** before starting design or implementation.
