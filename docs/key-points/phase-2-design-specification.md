## 📌 Design and Specification

Phase 2 focuses on **designing the system, preparing detailed specifications, and planning the testing phase**. This phase ensures the development team and QA have clear, actionable guidance for implementation.

---

### 1️⃣ Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

**Purpose:**  
Details **how the system will function**, based on the high-level requirements in the SRS.

**Key Points:**
- Describes **individual functions, inputs, outputs, and workflows**  
- Includes **business rules** and **validation logic**  
- Acts as a reference for developers and testers  

---

### 2️⃣ Figma (UI/UX Designs)

**Purpose:**  
Provides **visual guidance for user interfaces** and interaction design.

**Key Points:**
- Wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes  
- Defines **user flows and navigation**  
- Used by **designers, developers, and testers** for consistency  

---

### 3️⃣ High-Level Design (HLD)

**Purpose:**  
Defines the **system architecture, modules, and data flow** at a high level.

**Key Points:**
- System architecture diagrams  
- Module interactions and dependencies  
- Technology stack and integration points  

---

### 4️⃣ Low-Level Design (LLD)

**Purpose:**  
Breaks down HLD into **detailed logic, class diagrams, and database schemas**.

**Key Points:**
- Pseudocode or algorithms  
- Detailed database table structure  
- API contracts and data models  

---

### 5️⃣ Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Purpose:**  
Specifies **how different models or modules interact and share context** within the system architecture.

**Key Points:**
- Defines **context boundaries and communication protocols** between modules  
- Describes **data flow and dependencies**  
- Serves as a **reference for developers and architects** during implementation  
- Ensures **consistency and modularity** across the system


---

### 6️⃣ Technical Test Document (TTD)

**Purpose:**  
Outlines **technical testing approach** for the project.

**Key Points:**
- Test scenarios and conditions  
- Test environment and tools  
- Entry and exit criteria for testing  

---

### 7️⃣ Test Cases

**Purpose:**  
Lists **individual test steps** to validate functionality and system behavior.

**Key Points:**
- Steps, expected results, and actual results  
- Prioritization of test cases (Critical, Medium, Low)  
- Logging and tracking defects
